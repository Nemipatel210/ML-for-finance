## 📖 Project Overview

This project explores the intersection of Finance and Artificial Intelligence. By leveraging tools from the world of Finance alongside Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, we address pressing issues in the Fintech sector. 

The project is structured to guide the user from basic data manipulation to complex stock prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is divided into four distinct parts, building a structured learning path:

### Part 1: Data Preparation
In Part 1, we provide methods for reading financial data using the powerful pandas library. We leverage pandas' functionality to efficiently load and manipulate datasets. Additionally, this section covers the application of various functions to preprocess the data, ensuring its suitability for training machine learning models.

**Libraries used:**
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `talib`
* `requests`, `bs4`

### Part 2: Decision Trees and Random Forests
Part 2 delves into the implementation of decision trees and random forests, popular machine learning algorithms for classification and regression tasks. We provide detailed explanations and examples showcasing how to utilize these algorithms effectively for finance-related applications.

**Libraries used:**
* `sklearn` (DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, metrics)
* `xgboost`

### Part 3: Stock Prediction with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Part 3 focuses on stock prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). ANN is a powerful technique for modeling complex relationships within financial data and has gained significant popularity in finance. This section demonstrates the implementation of ANNs in Python, enabling users to forecast stock prices and make informed investment decisions.

**Libraries used:**
* `tensorflow` (Keras)
* `talos` (Hyperparameter optimization)
* `sklearn`
* `pandas`

### Part 4: Visualizing Neurons using Playground TensorFlow
Part 4 introduces the usage of Playground TensorFlow, a web-based tool that allows for interactive visualization of neural networks. This section demonstrates how to leverage Playground TensorFlow to gain insights into the behavior and functioning of neural networks, specifically for finance-related applications.
